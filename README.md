# Frame Protect Minecraft Spigot Plugin
This plugin protects frames that are on secured properties through [plotme](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/plotme-official.2131/) plugin. It prevents players from taking the items out of the frame.

This Plugin was created for Block-City by V3lop5. (But they never used it I guess.)
